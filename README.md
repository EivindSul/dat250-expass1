[Assignment](https://github.com/selabhvl/dat250public/blob/master/expassignments/expass1.md)
 
Goals of this exercise:
- Set up a development environment for java/gradle/docker. I am a nerd, so I use my terminal with neovim and such.
- Set up a minimal gradle project.
- Install the spring framework, and use it to make a "Hello world" web app.
- Add the project to git, and add a git action to run tests and build.
